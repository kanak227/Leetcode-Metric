## 🌐 **Deployment Link**

The app is deployed via GitHub Pages. To use the app, you need to access a demo server for enabling CORS. Use the following steps:

1. Visit the deployment link: [LeetCode Metrics App](kanak227.github.io/Leetcode-Metric/).
2. Enable CORS by visiting this link and clicking **"Request temporary access to the demo server"**:
   [CORS Anywhere Demo Server](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/).

   > **Note**: Without enabling this, the app may fail to fetch data due to CORS restrictions.

## 🛠️ **How to Use**

1. **Authorize**: Provide your LeetCode credentials for fetching personal metrics (if applicable).
2. **Analyze**: View detailed charts for solved problems categorized by:
   - Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
   - Topics and tags (e.g., Arrays, Dynamic Programming).
3. **Plan**: Use the insights to focus on weaker areas and track improvement over time.
